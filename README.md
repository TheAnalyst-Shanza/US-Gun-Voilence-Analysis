# US-Gun-Voilence-Analysis
This project analyzes gun violence incidents across the United States to uncover geographic, temporal, and demographic patterns. Using data from the Gun Violence Archive, it combines exploratory data analysis and Tableau visualizations to highlight key trends and support data-driven violence prevention strategies.

# Project Overview
This project analyzes patterns and trends in gun violence incidents across the United States using publicly available data.
The goal is to uncover insights about where, when, and why such incidents occur and to identify key factors contributing to gun-related injuries and fatalities.

# Motivation
Gun violence continues to be a significant public health and safety issue in the U.S.
By analyzing real-world data, this project aims to:
Understand temporal and geographic patterns in gun violence.
Support policy makers, law enforcement, and communities in developing data-informed prevention strategies.
Increase public awareness through clear and transparent visual storytelling.

# Objectives
Explore yearly, monthly, and daily trends in gun violence incidents.
Identify geographic hotspots with high incident concentrations.
Examine relationships between incident type, fatalities, and injuries.
Present findings through interactive Tableau dashboards and storyboards.

# Data Source
Data obtained from the Gun Violence Archive (GVA) or a similar verified public dataset.

# Dataset includes:
Date and location of each incident.
Number of people killed and injured.
Type of incident (mass shooting, domestic, accidental, etc.).
Geographic identifiers (city, state, latitude, longitude).

# Limitations
Data relies on reported incidents, which may introduce reporting bias or missing information.
Some contextual factors (e.g., socioeconomic conditions, policy changes, or firearm access) are not included.
Temporal coverage may vary depending on the dataset’s last update.
